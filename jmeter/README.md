# Assignment 3 Module 5-6

To run tests locally you need to have installed docker

## Running tests

just launch in current directory run.sh passing qty of users as parameter

e.g.

`bash run.sh 10`

This will prepare sergii_input.csv file with 10 users, modify SergiiScenario.jmx to need thread pool quantity and run jmeter with this scenario

Results will be saved in results folder.
